# Kossel-XL-printable-parts
Copy of files from builda3dprinter.eu, for printing all parts for a Kossel or Kossel XL delta 3d printer.

This company is no longer trading, but I kept a copy of the STL files that were publicly available on their website.  
The Kossel is an open source design (see: https://reprap.org/wiki/Kossel), so I think there is no infringement of
intellectual property rights.

There are also files at:

https://www.thingiverse.com/electronhacks/collections/kossel-xl-2020-complete-parts/page:1

but I have not used those.
